I design and develop **websites** to meet the needs of my clients. I still have a lot of new technologies to learn but that will come with time.

**Originally**, I started learning Python for my own needs but then I turned to **web** and **software development** to follow my passion. For the moment I work alone. To meet my future needs I plan to learn how to make logos through the use of software such as Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator.
