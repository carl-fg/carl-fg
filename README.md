### Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

I design and develop websites to meet the needs of my clients. I still have a lot of new technologies to learn but that will come with time.

<strong>Originally<strong />, I started learning Python for my own needs but then I turned to web and software development to follow my passion. For the moment I work alone. To meet my future needs I plan to learn how to make logos through the use of software such as Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator.
